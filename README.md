# VectorHub: Advanced Vector Search & Retrieval System

## Project Overview
VectorHub is a production-ready vector search system that demonstrates state-of-the-art approaches to semantic search and retrieval at scale. The system implements multiple embedding models, vector search algorithms, and retrieval approaches to provide flexible and powerful semantic search capabilities.

### Key Features
- Multi-model embedding pipeline supporting different embedding approaches
- Scalable vector search implementation using HNSW (https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/hnsw/) and Faiss (https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/faiss/)
- Advanced retrieval system with hybrid search (combining vector and text search)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation with LLM integration
- Comprehensive MLOps pipeline for model deployment and monitoring
- Benchmarking suite for comparing different embedding and retrieval approaches

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Embedding Service**
   - Multiple embedding models (SentenceTransformers, OpenAI embeddings)
   - Model fine-tuning pipeline
   - Embedding caching and optimization

2. **Vector Storage & Search**
   - Primary: Weaviate for production vector storage
   - Secondary: Faiss for rapid prototyping
   - PGVector integration for hybrid search capabilities

3. **Retrieval System**
   - Hybrid search combining BM25 and vector similarity (https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained)
   - Re-ranking pipeline
   - RAG implementation with configurable LLM backends

4. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI implementation with async support
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Rate limiting and caching

5. **MLOps Pipeline**
   - Docker containerization
   - Kubeflow pipelines for training and deployment
   - Monitoring and observability
